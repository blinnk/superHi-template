# A simple base template for working with [SuperHi](https://www.superhi.com/) lessons in your own text editor ðŸ™ƒ

What's included:

* SuperHi's base.css file
* A basic index.html, style.css and index.js file
* Parcel bundler for adding any necessary project dependencies via yarn/npm

I made this for myself because I prefer using my own editor when following course material. SuperHi's editor utilizes a custom CSS reset file (base.css), making it necessary to log in, create a project in the editor, and copy/paste these files into your own directory for each project in order to follow along with the same styles

Steps:

* clone the repo
* run
  ```yarn install```
  or
  ```npm install```
* run
  ```yarn dev```
  or
  ```npm run dev```

If you'd like to create an optimized build folder to host on your website/server:

* run
  ```yarn build```
  or
  ```npm run build```
